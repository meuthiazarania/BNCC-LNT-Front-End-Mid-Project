        <hr>
        </hr>
        <p class="justify-text"><span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> is a calm, reserved, and polite man, who holds
          an air of nostalgia. Whereas he
          is said to have a
          stoic demeanor for duty, <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> also has a sentimental side. He knows much
          about <span class="text-warning">Liyue</span> history and culture
          in part due to his time as the <span class="text-warning">Geo Archon</span>. He has many experiences and
          memories, as he was a god
          well before The Seven even existed and one of the oldest still living in Teyvat. He holds philosophical ideas
          towards money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including those that have been forgotten or warped
          over time.
        </p>
        <img src="/Assets/zhongli meme.jpg" alt="..." width="150" height="150">
        <p class="mt-2">
          <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> tends to forget about <span class="text-warning">Mora</span> in
          transactions, agreeing to spend large sums of it without having any Mora
          on hand and even taking "discounts" as granted despite being an obvious scam. He often ends up relying on
          his acquaintances for financial support, such as the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or Childe. Although he works for
          Hu Tao, he does not like her childish behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is later revealed that <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span>'s "carelessness" stems from being the
          creator of Mora. With the Gnosis
          allowing him to create limitless Mora, he never had to worry about running low on his personal finances.
          Unfortunately, when he chose to live among mortals, he lacked the foresight to find an alternative for them to
          continue minting Mora in his absence, along with creating a retirement fund for himself. As a result, he
          shamelessly spends the Mora of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being the reminiscent person he is, <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> enjoys Osmanthus wine as it was
          the drink he and his former Archon
          friends used to have when they met up in Liyue. He dislikes seafood as it reminds him of the promise he made
          to his people in the past when he fought a particularly annoying type of sea creature, although he does not
          mind eating them if they have been ground to a pulp.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-2">Appearance</h3>
        <hr>
        </hr>
        <p>
          <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> uses the tall male model. He has fair skin, amber eyes with yellow
          diamond-shaped pupils and red
          eyeliner on the lower lids of his eyes, and mostly short dark brown hair with a longer fringe on the right
          side of his face and <span class="text-warning">Geo</span>-amber tips that glow when he uses his Elemental
          Skill or Elemental Burst. There is
          one section of his hair on the back of his head that is waist-length instead of being cut short.
        </p>
        Zhongli's form appears to be the same as the one he uses as an Archon, as seen in his Statues of The Seven and
        various cinematics that show him as an Archon.
        <p>
          The Geo Vision seen at the small of his back behaves like other characters' Visions in most gameplay; however,
          it is not a real Vision, and there are a select few gameplay mechanics that reflect this.
          In <span class="text-warning">Archon Quest Rite of Descension in Chapter I: Act I - Of the Land Amidst
            Monoliths</span>, Zhongli as Rex Lapis
          appeared as a brown and amber Chinese dragon with gold accents known as the Exuvia.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-2">Summary</h3>
        <hr>
        </hr>
        <p>
          On the surface, <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> currently serves as a consultant for the Wangsheng
          Funeral Parlor. He works under "The
          Director," Hu Tao, and seems to be well-versed in an abundance of subjects. This has earned him the respect of
          Liyue's citizens, granting him the label of an old-fashioned gentleman. However, this knowledge did not come
          from thin air. Zhongli is in truth the latest mortal vessel of the Geo Archon, Morax, also known as Liyue's
          overlord and protector: <span class="text-warning">Rex Lapis</span>. He now wanders the streets of Liyue, as
          he "ought to be here to witness its
          rise and fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the people of Liyue, their Archon carries many titles: <span class="text-warning">the Geo Archon, the God
            of Contracts, the God of
            History, the Lord of Rock, the Groundbreaker, and the Warrior God among them.</span> Having lived for over
          6000
          years, <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> has first-hand experience with much of Teyvat's history. He
          has presumably witnessed many of
          Teyvat's events, such as the cataclysm, the creation of the Chasm, and the fall of Aria, Sonnet and Canon.
          Nonetheless, he is most known for his cold-blooded participation in the Archon War, and his founding of Liyue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around the beginning of the Archon War, <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> was the co-ruler of the
          prosperous Guili Assembly alongside
          the God of Dust, Guizhong, and the adepti. However, their combined forces could not stop the tides of war from
          taking the life of its ruler, Guizhong. During a certain battle, despite their efforts and the aid of the
          adepti, Guizhong was overpowered by the opponent and the Guili Assembly was destroyed. After a massive flood
          swept through the area 3700 years ago, Zhongli was forced to move his people south of <span
            class="text-warning">Mt. Tianheng</span> and
          established <span class="text-warning">Liyue Harbour</span>, where it stands to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In present time, <span class="text-warning">Zhongli</span> has handed over his gnosis and with it, he has
          lifted the heavy weight of rulership
          he has borne for millennia. As the gnosis is now in Fatui possession, Zhongli is no longer inclined to act as
          Archon. He now spends his time reminiscing and enjoying the mortal experience. However, it is not to be
          believed that his story is even close to being over yet.
